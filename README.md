## Thought Process for Ex. 1
When considering making a layout such as this, the first thing that came to mind was to use containers, rows, and columns. This will allow for the layout to be compacted into spaces and alignments that will form for a symmetrical layout and with correct margining. I gave space between each employee to not crowd the staff memebers and to give a better UI experience, making it more pleasing to see. Hover effects are used to show slight enhancement. Also is mobile friendly and will be showing one staff member on each row.

## Thought Process for Ex. 2
When creating a slide, I wanted to show some sort of animation or transformation when the user were to hover on the image. When hovering, the text will show and slide to the right of the image so that the user is able to read the information regarding it. Not too much text is showing because you don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information. Simplicity is key: simple transformations and scaling makes it look best.

## Thought Process for Ex. 3
When creating the navbar, it's important to respond to the user which link they are clicking on. When hovering on each link, the user is given feedback with color changes to indiciate which link they are about to click on. When active, the link will remain a static color, notifying which link is currently clicked. For the dropdown, user experience makes most sense to display the dropdown components when it is hovered on. So I did just that. When user hovers over dropdown, it will display the components nested within it. Consistency is key, so I kept all colors that same.

## Thought Process for Bonus
Create two for loops, one list is being compared to the elements in the other. When a word is found in both lists, display that word when user clicks on the button. jQuery is used to toggle classes and create elements dynamically when button is clicked.
